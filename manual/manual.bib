title = {The conditioned reconstructed process},
abstract = {We investigate a neutral model for speciation and extinction, the constant rate birth-death process. The process is conditioned to have n extant species today, we look at the tree distribution of the reconstructed trees--i.e. the trees without the extinct species. Whereas the tree shape distribution is well-known and actually the same as under the pure birth process, no analytic results for the speciation times were known. We provide the distribution for the speciation times and calculate the expectations analytically. This characterizes the reconstructed trees completely. We will show how the results can be used to date phylogenies.},

title = {Distribution of Indel lengths},
abstract = {Protein sequence alignment has become a widely used method in the study of newly sequenced proteins. Most sequence alignment methods use an affine gap penalty to assign scores to insertions and deletions. Although affine gap penalties represent the relative ease of extending a gap compared with initializing a gap, it is still an obvious oversimplification of the real processes that occur during sequence evolution. To improve the efficiency of sequence alignment methods and to obtain a better understanding of the process of sequence evolution, we wanted to find a more accurate model of insertions and deletions in homologous proteins. In this work, we extract the probability of a gap occurrence and the resulting gap length distribution in distantly related proteins (sequence identity < 25\%) using alignments based on their common structures. We observe a distribution of gaps that can be fitted with a multiexponential with four distinct components. The results suggest new approaches to modeling insertions and deletions in sequence alignments.},

title = {Empirical analysis of protein insertions and deletions determining parameters for the correct placement of gaps in protein sequence alignments},
abstract = {To understand how protein segments are inserted and deleted during divergent evolution, a set of pairwise alignments contained exactly one gap, and therefore arising from the first insertion-deletion (indel) event in the time separating the homologs, was examined. The alignments showed that "structure breaking" amino acids (PGDNS) were preferred within and flanking gapped regions, as are two residues with hydrophilic side-chains (QE) that frequently occur at the surface of protein folds. Conversely, hydrophobic residues (FMILYVW) occur infrequently within and flanking the gapped region. These preferences are modestly different in protein pairs separated by an episode of adaptive evolution, than in pairs diverging under strong functional constraints. Surprisingly, regions near an indel have not evolved more rapidly than the sequence pair overall, showing no evidence that an indel event must be compensated by local amino acid replacement. The gap-lengths are best approximated by a Zipfian distribution, with the probability of a gap of length L decreasing as a function of L(-1.8). These features are largely independent of the length of the gap and the extent of divergence (measured by both silent and non-silent sequence changes) separating the two proteins. Surprisingly, amino acid repeats were discovered in more than a third of the polypeptide segments in and around the gap. These correspond to repeats in the DNA sequence. This suggests that a signature of the mechanism by which indels occur in the DNA sequence remains in the encoded protein sequences. These data suggest specific tools to score gap placement in an alignment. They also suggest tools that distinguish true indels from gaps created by mistaken gene finding, including under-predicted and over-predicted introns. By providing mechanisms to identify errors, the tools will enhance the value of genome sequence databases in support of integrated paleogenomics strategies used to extract functional information in a post-genomic environment.},
